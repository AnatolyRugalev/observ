# observ: Observability Testing

`observ` is a set of Go test tools to simplify testing of observability data generated by applications.

## Status

This toolkit is stable enough to use in tests. 

API will likely have some breaking changes between minor pre-v1
releases, but I will put as much effort as reasonably possible to provide upgrade instructions, compatibility layers 
and tools with each breaking change.

## How To Use

Sorry, this is very early release, please take a look at [hello_test.go](examples/hello/hello_test.go) to see how it 
works.

## Why

The code of modern Go app has a lot of metadata that can be used to accompany regular tests. Some ideas:
1. Testing asyncronous components (e.g. block the test until the log message is emitted)
2. Testing cache hits: just check Prometheus counter instead of mocking
3. Creating rules for log format: when application logs follow a contract (e.g. used in data pipelines, served from 
   the API
4. Testing correctness of mission-critical metrics (e.g. metrics used in autoscaling and alerting)

## Roadmap

1. More log collectors
2. Documentation and more examples
3. More assertion functions
4. Test coverage and CI
5. Tracing support

## Contribution

There are no rules for contribution yet. Open and issue or PR if you feel like it.

## testify

A part of [testify](https://github.com/stretchr/testify) is copied into this repo to fix bad error traces. This code
