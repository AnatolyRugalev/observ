# observ: Observability Testing

`observ` is a set of Go test tools to simplify testing of observability data generated by applications.

Status: stable enough to use in Go tests.

## How To Use

Sorry, this is very early release, please take a look at [hello_test.go](examples/hello/hello_test.go) to see how it 
works.

## What's Missing

There are a lot of helper functions missing, please feel free to open an issue (or PR) if you want to add a new 
assertion, filtering or grouping function. 

Tracing is not supported yet.

## Why

The code of modern Go app has a lot of metadata that can be used to accompany regular tests. Some ideas:
1. Testing cache hits: just check Prometheus counter instead of mocking
2. Creating rules for log format: when application logs follow a contract (e.g. used in data pipelines, served from 
   the API
3. Testing correctness of mission-critical metrics (e.g. metrics used in autoscaling and alerting)

## Contribution

There are no rules for contribution yet. Open and issue or PR if you feel like it.

## testify

A part of [testify](https://github.com/stretchr/testify) is copied into this repo to fix bad error traces. This code 
is licensed via MIT License, same as `observ`.
